# React Task Manager

A simple web application built with React that allows users to manage tasks. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks, with the ability to mark tasks as completed. The application also provides a filtering mechanism to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only uncompleted tasks.

## Features

- **Add Task:** Users can add a new task with a title and an unchecked checkbox.

- **Edit Task:** Users can edit the title of a task.

- **Delete Task:** Users can delete a task.

- **Task Completion:** Users can mark a task as completed by checking the checkbox.

- **Filtering:** Users can filter tasks to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only uncompleted tasks.

## Components

The project is structured with the following React components:

- **App:** The main component that manages the overall state of the application.

- **TaskList:** Renders the list of tasks and manages task-related actions.

- **Task:** Represents an individual task with options to edit, delete, and mark as completed.

## State Management

React's built-in state is used for managing the state of tasks.

## Styling

CSS is used for styling the application. The styles are kept in a separate `styles.css` file.
